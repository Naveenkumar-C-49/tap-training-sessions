## HTML CSS JS


### JS Electron framework used for create bundle
#### Three kinds of application
	web gmail
	desktop
		Objective -C (swift) (apple)- Native
		C# - Microsoft - Native
		c,c++ - Native Windows
		Java oracle one language - hybrid
			use JVM	
	Mobile
		Objective -C (swift) (apple)- Native
		C# - Microsoft - Native
		Java oracle one language - hybrid
			use JVM	

''Web application
	UI-FrontEnd-client side scripting application(Javascript)
		Frameworks/libraries - react,Vue,Angular
		library - Jquery,Lodash,underscore
		markup - HTML
		style sheet - CSS
	Server side languauges - backend - (python,php,NodeJs,Ruby ,R, Golang,Java,C#,perl)

Topics covered today are,
1) Codepen software
2) 3 types of applications
 i)web applications
 ii)desktop applcations
 iii)mobile applications
3)Web application
FRONTEND - client side scripting
Frontend frameworks - React, Vue, Angular
Libraries - JQuery, Lodash, Underscore
Markup language - HTML
stylesheet - CSS
BACKEND - Server side applications:
languages - Python, PHP, NodeJS, Ruby, R, Golang, Java, C#, perl
Frameworks:
Python - Flash, Django
PHP - Laraval, Code ignitor
NodeJS - ExpressJS, Koa
Ruby - Ruby on Rails
Java - Spring, Hibernate
4) Desktop applications
Lanuages:
Java by Oracle (applets, swing)  - HYBRID APPLICATION
Objective C by swift, Apple iOS  - NATIVE APPLICATION
C# by microsoft                  - NATIVE APPLICATION
C, C++(open source)              - NATIVE APPLICATION
JVM - Java Virtual Machine would need only less space RAM to process, avoids crashing
Java is a high level language and founded by SUN microsystems
After outdation of Java, JavaScript evolved, it uses electronic framework and uses bundles to process each data.
5) Mobile Operating Systems:
Windows developed by Microsoft,language used to develop is C#
iOS developed by Apple,language used to develop is C swift
Java developed by Google
All these are NATIVE.
6)JAVASCRIPT:
Ionic framework - Apache Cordova
React and Vue framework are NATIVE
7) Dart belongs to FLUTTER framework.
8)Developer stack:
 i)MEAN stack:
 M - MongoDB
 E - ExpresssJS
 A - Angular
 N - NodeJS
 ii)MERN stack:
 M - MongoDB
 E - ExpresssJS
 R - React
 N - NodeJS
 iii)PERN stack:
 P - Postgress
 E - ExpresssJS
 R - React
 N - NodeJS
9)JavaScript:
JavaScript is not a language
System understands BINARY language
Browser understands JavaScript
Rust is the most using language and uses DENOJS platform
10)Types of Developers:
Frontend, backend, full stack and polyglot developers
11)Roles:
	i)Developers
	ii)QA's
		a)manual QA Engineers
		b)automation QA Engineers
	iii)Project manager
	iv)DevOps engineer works on server management and manages VCS, CI server, APP server, Web server and cache server
	v)support engineer
		a)Chat support engineer
		b)L1 support engineer
		c)L2 support engineer
		d)L3 support engineer	
	vi)Data Engineer
	vii)Database admin
